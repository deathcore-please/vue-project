The event type must be displayed as a coloured label with green if access authorised, or red is access is denied for any reason. Date time must be displayed in DD/MM/YYYY HH:MM:SS format, and must be sorted with the newest events first. #

Attached above is a Zip File containing all of the information that you will need to complete the task. We have also attached a screenshot of what it should roughly look like completed.
