# INTERVIEW TASK - Learned how to use .Net and VUE!

I create a vue new page to display the events stored in the SQLite database in the database folder of the project file. It has the following columns:

- Event Id
- Date Time
- Event Type
- Location
- Fob Code

The location displays the area the event occurred in, and all of the parent areas above it in the chain. Each area in the areas chain in location is separated by a " > " symbol. The event type is displayed as a coloured label with green if access authorised, or red is access is denied for any reason. Date time is displayed in DD/MM/YYYY HH:MM:SS format, and must be sorted with the newest events first. #

The task took me a few hours (about 3-4 hours) of solid sitting to complete, since I had to learn vue from scratch and draw parallels to my knowledge of API integration from a Python-DJango framework to a .Net 
framework. COming from an ML background, this was an extemely interesting task to complete, and it really helped me get a working knowledge of how frontend and backend work, how WebAPIs are hosted, how to use API 
endpoints, and most importantly, how to troubleshoot while using an API endpoint for frontend. #

While I did use ChatGPT for this task, its role was limited to function implementation such that I had an understanding of the project at a functional level making it far easier for me to understand and debug the code.
